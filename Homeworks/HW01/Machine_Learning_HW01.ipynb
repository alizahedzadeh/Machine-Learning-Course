        "> Some estimators (such as a `SimpleImputer`) can also transform a dataset; these are called *transformers*. Once again, the API is simple: the transformation is performed by the `transform()` method with the dataset to transform as a parameter. It returns the transformed dataset. This transformation generally relies on the learned parameters, as is the case for a `SimpleImputer`. All transformers also have a convenience method called `fit_transform()`, which is equivalent to calling `fit()` and then `transform()` (but sometimes `fit_transform()` is optimized and runs much faster).\n",

        "Although Scikit-Learn provides many useful transformers, you will need to write your own for tasks such as custom transformations, cleanup operations, or combining specific attributes. For transformations that don’t require any training, you can just write a function that takes a NumPy array as input and outputs the transformed array. Scikit-learn provides us with `FunctionTransformer` class for these scenarios. Logarithm transformer is one of them which does not need any training.  \n",

        "`FunctionTransformer` is very handy, but what if you would like your transformer to be trainable, learning some parameters in the `fit()` method and using them later in the `transform()` method? For this, you need to write a custom class. Scikit-Learn relies on duck typing, so this class does not have to inherit from any particular base class. All it needs is three methods: `fit()` (which must return self), `transform()`, and `fit_transform()`.\n",

        "<font color='#D61E85' size='+2'>**Q18:**</font> Robust scaling is a technique that is less sensitive to outliers compared to standardization. This approach is useful when dealing with datasets that contain significant outliers. First, explain how it works and write down its formula. Then try to implement it from scratch by writing a custom class. In addition to `fit()` and `transform()` methods it should contains `inverse_transform()`: executing `scaler.inverse_transform(scaler.fit_transform(X))` should return an array very close to `X`. Then add support for feature names: set `feature_names_in_` in the `fit()` method if the input is a DataFrame. This attribute should be a NumPy array of column names. Lastly, implement the `get_feature_names_out()` method: it should have one optional `input_features=None` argument. If passed, the method should check that its length matches `n_features_in_`, and it should match `feature_names_in_` if it is defined; then `input_features` should be returned. If `input_features` is `None`, then the method should either return `feature_names_in_` if it is defined or `np.array([\"x0\", \"x1\", ...])` with length `n_features_in_` otherwise."
